# Verified Downloads
Verified Downloads is a solution for Envato Market authors. With this plugin only your Envato Market customers (and nobody else) can download files from your website. People must enter their Item Purchase Code to download the file. The link is encrypted and valid for a limited period of time to avoid its sharing over Internet. As an administrator you can decide either users must purchse certain Envato item to have a chance to download the file (for example, before downloading file "#1", user must buy item A from Envato), or the file is available for all of your Envato customers. Use Verified Downloads to distribute free stuff (such as add-ons, bonuses, gifts, patches, etc.) among your customers. It will stimulate people to purchase your items on Envato Market.
